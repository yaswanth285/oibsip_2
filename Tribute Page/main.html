   <h2 class="biography"><center><u>A brief biography of S.S.RajaMouli</u></center></h2>
   <p class="biography">Koduri Srisaila Sri Rajamouli (born 10 October 1973) is an Indian film director and screenwriter who primarily works in Telugu cinema and is known for his action, fantasy, and epic genre films. 
    He is the highest grossing Indian director of all time[2] and the highest-paid director in India.
    He is a recipient of various national and international honours including a New York Film Critics Circle award, a Critics' Choice Movie Award, two Saturn Awards, and three National Film Awards. 
    In 2016, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri, for his contributions in the field of Art.</p>

    <h3 class="biography"><center><u>Film Making Style</u></center></h3>
    <p class="biography">A self confessed "film freak",Rajamouli's penchant for filmmaking is best captured by the word "emotion".
        He has often stated that his films are based on stories driven by human emotions.
        Revenge happens to be a prominent theme in his films.
        Scaling up his work with every film, Rajamouli has maintained his signature style of filmmaking that allows the audience to simmer in the thrills and the emotions of the story with less dialogue.
        All his films end with a print of his trademark circular stamp, stating: "an S. S. Rajamouli film".
        Film critic Baradwaj Rangan opined that Rajamouli is a "great storyteller" who takes up common concepts and develops them in a novel acceptable way.
        Production designer Sabu Cyril, a four-time National Award winner for Best Art Direction, who worked for the Baahubali duology, said his team came up with as many as 25,000 sketches to design the various grand sets for the film to satisfy the rigorous visualisation standards of Rajamouli which were grand and at the same time, 
        gone into very minute details ensuring that every pillar and wall had the right design. 
        Cyril said, "Rajamouli makes no compromises.”</p>

    <h3 class="biography"><center><u>Personal Life</u></center></h3>
    <p class="biography">Rajamouli married Rama, sister-in-law of his cousin Keeravani in 2001.
        After their marriage, Rama worked as a costume designer for many of Rajamouli's films.
        He adopted Karthikeya, Rama's son from her previous marriage. 
        The couple also has an adopted daughter Mayookha.
        Karthikeya is married to Pooja Prasad, niece of Telugu actor Jagapathi Babu.
        Rajamouli's cousin, M. M. Keeravani has worked as the music composer for all of his films.
        His other cousins Kalyani Malik and M. M. Srilekha are also music composers.
        S. S. Kanchi, a screenwriter and actor known for his role in the sitcom Amrutham is also one of his cousins.
        He collaborated with Rajamouli as a script doctor on many of his films and also acted in four of his films.
        Raja Koduri, a Executive vice-president at Intel is also a cousin of his.
        Rajamouli considers K. Raghavendra Rao as his guru and mentor.
        He called Gunnam Gangaraju his philosopher and guide who made an impact on his worldview.</p>
